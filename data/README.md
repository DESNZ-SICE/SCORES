Weather data needs to be placed in here.

Each type of data should have its own folder, the folder must contain one csv file per location and a csvfile 'site_locs.csv' which contains a list of all sites and their latitude and longitudes.

The individual csv files should contain two columns, the first containing the datetime and the second the wind speed in m/s or irradiance in KJ/m2
