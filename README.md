# SCORES
## Introduction
SCORES (Storage and Cost Optimisation for Renewable Energy Systems) is an energy system model used to analyse the need for renewable generation and storage. 

## Objective
Archival weather data is compared to demand data to predict the need for electricity storage. 

## Data/Inputs
SCORES uses NASA satellite data from MERRA-2, available on an hourly basis for a range of weather years. This data needs to be downloaded from NASA: the guide for downloading the data can be found  

You may want to use a table to present this information. These are not compulsory
| Data              | Quality and year last updated | Source |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Data source 1 (e.g. National Buildings Database)       |   Good , 2024  | Report |
| Data source 2 (e.g. data collected as part of the project          |   Good  , 2024 | Can be found in ERT OneDrive  |
|  Data from reference documents |  Average, 2020 and 2015   | Link|
| Data source 4 |  2024 good data quality   | Link |
